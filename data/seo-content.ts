        title: 'How to Merge PDF Files Online (Free & Secure)',
        htmlContext: `
Merging PDF files is one of the most common document management tasks. Whether you are a student combining lecture notes, a professional compiling a report from different departments, or just organizing your personal documents, having a reliable **PDF Merger** is essential. Our tool allows you to combine multiple PDF documents into a single file quickly, securely, and without any cost.

### Why Merge PDF Files?

Keeping track of multiple PDF files can be a nightmare. By merging them into one, you can:

* **Simplify Sharing:** Send one file via email instead of attaching ten separate documents.
* **Improve Organization:** Keep related documents together (e.g., invoices, receipts, and contracts for a specific project).
* **Enhance Readability:** Create a logical flow of information for your readers.
* **Print Efficiently:** Clear up your print queue by sending just one merged document to the printer.

### Is it Secure?

**Yes, absolutely.** We prioritize your privacy above all else. Unlike many other online tools, our PDF merging process happens *client-side* whenever possible, or using secure, ephemeral processing servers that delete your files immediately after the job is done. We do not store your documents, and no one else has access to them.

### Tips for Perfect PDF Merging

To get the best results, ensure all your PDF files are not password-protected before uploading (or unlock them using our [Unlock PDFToolskit](/unlock-pdf)). You can drag and drop your files to reorder them exactly how you want them to appear in the final document. Once you're happy with the order, just click "Merge" and download your simplified file instantly!

    '/compress-pdf': {
        title: 'Compress PDF: Reduce File Size Without Losing Quality',
        htmlContext: `
Large PDF files can be a major headache. They clog up your email inbox, take forever to upload, and can even be rejected by portals with strict file size limits (like job application sites or government portals). Our **PDF Compressor** solves this problem instantly by optimizing your files to the smallest possible size while maintaining excellent quality.

### How Does PDF Compression Work?

PDF files often contain high-resolution images, embedded fonts, and hidden metadata that bloat their size. Our smart compression algorithm:

* **Resamples Images:** It intelligently reduces the DPI of images to a web-friendly standard (usually 72-144 DPI) without making them look pixelated.
* **Removes Unused Objects:** It cleans up the internal structure of the PDF file.
* **Optimizes Fonts:** It ensures only the necessary font characters are embedded.

### Best Use Cases for Compression

You should compress your PDF if you are:

* **Emailing Attachments:** Gmail and Outlook have 25MB limits. Compressing can shrink a 50MB report down to 5MB.
* **Archiving Documents:** Save disk space on your computer or cloud storage.
* **Web Publishing:** Smaller PDFs load faster for your website visitors, improving SEO and user experience.

### Free & Private

Just like our other tools, this service is completely free and respectful of your privacy. Your files are processed securely and are never shared with third parties. Try it now—just drag, drop, and shrink!

    '/split-pdf': {
        title: 'Split PDF: Extract Pages or Separate Documents Instantly',
        htmlContext: `
Sometimes you don't need the whole book—you just need one chapter. Our **Split PDF** tool gives you total control over your documents, allowing you to extract specific pages, split a large file into multiple smaller ones, or just remove unwanted sections.

### Different Ways to Split

Our tool offers flexible options to handle any scenario:

* **Extract Specific Pages:** Enter a range (e.g., "1-5, 10") to save only those pages as a new PDF.
* **Split by Ranges:** Break a 100-page document into 10 separate 10-page documents.
* **Burst Split:** Save every single page of your PDF as a separate file automatically.

### Why Split a PDF?

Common scenarios include:

* **Legal & Business:** You scanned a large batch of unrelated invoices together and need to separate them.
* **Sharing:** You want to share just one article from a large magazine or journal.
* **Size Management:** Splitting a massive file into smaller chunks makes it easier to upload or email.

### Fast Processing

No need to download heavy software like Adobe Acrobat. Our browser-based tool works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and mobile devices. It handles even large files with ease, so you can get your work done in seconds.

    '/pdf-to-word': {
        title: 'Convert PDF to Word: Edit Your Documents Easily',
        htmlContext: `
PDFs are great for sharing, but they are a nightmare to edit. If you have ever tried to fix a typo or update a paragraph in a PDF, you know the struggle. Our **PDF to Word** converter transforms your static PDF into a fully editable Microsoft Word document (.docx) in seconds.

### Preserves Your Layout

The biggest challenge with conversion is keeping the formatting intact. Our advanced engine intelligently recognizes:

* **Text Columns:** It detects paragraphs and headers, so you don't get broken lines.
* **Tables:** Excel tables inside PDFs remain editable tables in Word.
* **Images:** Photos and diagrams are placed in their correct positions.

### Scanned PDFs? No Problem

If your PDF is a scan of a paper document, standard converters just give you an image inside a Word doc. Our tool (paired with our [OCR technology](/ocr-pdf)) extracts the actual text so you can edit it freely.

    '/pdf-to-jpg': {
        title: 'PDF to JPG: Convert Pages to High-Quality Images',
        htmlContext: `
Need to share a PDF page on social media? Or maybe you need to insert a PDF slide into a PowerPoint presentation? Viewing PDFs requires special software, but images work everywhere. Our **PDF to JPG** tool converts every page of your document into a separate high-resolution image.

### High Fidelity Conversion

We render your pages at high DPI (Dots Per Inch) to ensure that text stays crisp and photos remain sharp. You won't get blurry, unreadable screenshots.

### Batch Download

Converting a 100-page document? You don't have to save images one by one. We package all your converted pages into a single ZIP file for easy download.

    '/jpg-to-pdf': {
        title: 'JPG to PDF: Create Professional Documents from Images',
        htmlContext: `
Sending 20 separate photo attachments in an email is unprofessional and annoying for the recipient. With our **JPG to PDF** converter, you can compile all your images into a single, clean PDF file.

### Perfect for...

* **Portfolios:** Showcasing design work or photography in a curated book.
* **Receipts:** Combining photos of receipts for expense reports.
* **Scans:** Merging photos of documents into a single digital file.

### Full Control

You can drag and drop to reorder images, adjust margins, and choose the page orientation (A4, Letter, etc.) to ensure your document looks exactly how you want it.

    '/protect-pdf': {
        title: 'Password Protect PDF: Secure Your Sensitive Data',
        htmlContext: `
Security is paramount when sharing financial statements, legal contracts, or personal records. Our **Protect PDF** tool adds robust 128-bit AES encryption to your file, ensuring that only people with the password can open it.

### How Encryption Works

When you set a password, we scramble the contents of the file mathematically. Without the correct key (password), the data is just random noise. This protection works on all standard PDF viewers, including Adobe Acrobat, Chrome, and Preview.

*Note: Please remember your password! Because we process files securely and don't store them, we cannot recover a lost password for you.*
`
    },
    '/unlock-pdf': {
        title: 'Unlock PDF: Remove Passwords and Restrictions',
        htmlContext: `
It's annoying to enter a password every time you open a file you use daily. If you know the password but want to remove it permanently, our **Unlock PDF** tool creates a new, unprotected copy of your document.

### Did You Forget the Password?

Please note that this tool is designed to **remove known passwords** for convenience. It is not a hacking tool. If a file is strongly encrypted and you do not know the password, it is mathematically impossible to open it with standard tools.

### Remove Printing Restrictions

Some PDFs open without a password but prevent you from printing or copying text. Our tool can often remove these "Owner Permissions" restrictions instantly.

    '/rotate-pdf': {
        title: 'Rotate PDF: Fix Upside-Down Pages Permanently',
        htmlContext: `
Scanned a document upside down? Or have a mix of landscape and portrait pages that twist your neck? Standard PDF viewers only rotate the view temporarily. Our **Rotate PDF** tool changes the file itself.

### Precision Control

You don't have to rotate the whole document. You can:

* Rotate **individual pages** by hovering over them.
* Rotate **all pages** at once.
* Mix and match (e.g., rotate page 1 left, page 2 right).

Once saved, the file will open correctly on any device or printer.

    '/organize-pdf': {
        title: 'Organize PDF: Rearrange, Sort, and Delete Pages',
        htmlContext: `
Your PDF shouldn't be set in stone. Use our **Organize PDF** tool to take full control of your document's structure. It's like having the paper pages on a desk in front of you.

### What Can You Do?

* **Drag & Drop:** Simply click and hold a page to move it to a new position. Changes are updated instantly.
* **Delete:** Found a blank page or an error? Trash it with one click.
* **Sort:** Manually reorder a jumbled scan into the correct sequence.

### Client-Side Speed

This tool runs entirely in your browser. Your document doesn't need to upload to a server to be reorganized, which means it's instant and 100% private.

    '/remove-pages': {
        title: 'Remove Pages from PDF: Instant Cleanup',
        htmlContext: `
Downloaded a 50-page Report but only need the executive summary? Or scanned a document and accidentally included a blank sheet? **Remove Pages** is the quickest way to slim down your PDF.

### Visual Selection

We show you thumbnails of every page. Just click the ones you want to delete (or type a range like "1, 3-5"). When you hit delete, they vanish, and the remaining pages renumber themselves automatically.

### Reduce File Size

Deleting unwanted pages is also a great way to reduce file size before emailing. Why send the cover page and legal disclaimer if they aren't needed?
`
    },
    '/extract-pages': {
        title: 'Extract PDF Pages: Save Only What You Need',
        htmlContext: `
Sometimes you don't want to delete pages; you want to **keep** specific ones as a new file. **Extract Pages** lets you pull specific information out of a large document without modifying the original.

### Scenario

Imagine you have a 100-page bank statement but you only need to show your accountant the transactions from July. You can simply extract pages 72-74 and save them as a new PDF titled "July Transactions."

The original 100-page file remains untouched.

        htmlContext: `
There is nothing worse than printing a loose-leaf document without page numbers. If you drop it, it's chaos. Our **Page Numbering** tool adds professional headers or footers to your existing PDF.

### Customizable Options

* **Position:** Top, Bottom, Left, Right, or Center.
* **Format:** "Page 1", "1 of 10", or just "1".
* **Range:** Skip the cover page and start numbering from page 2 (as page 1).

        htmlContext: `
Prevent unauthorized copying or mark documents as "DRAFT" or "CONFIDENTIAL" with our **Watermark PDF** tool. Watermarking stamps text or an image over your pages.

### Smart Layering

Watermarks can be placed *over* the content (visible) or *under* the content (background). You can adjust transparency so the text remains readable while clearly displaying your mark.

This is essential for photographers, designers, and businesses sharing sensitive proposals.

        htmlContext: `
Is your PDF surrounded by huge white margins? Or did you scan a receipt on a full A4 page? **Crop PDF** lets you trim the visible area of the page, just like cropping a photo on your phone.

### Consistency Matters

You can set a single crop box and apply it to every page in the document. This is perfect for cleaning up scanned books where margins shift, or for preparing a document for printing on specialized paper sizes.

### Three Ways to Sign

* **Draw:** Use your mouse or finger (on mobile) to sketch your signature.
* **Type:** Type your name and choose a handwriting-style font.
* **Upload:** Use a picture of your wet-ink signature.

You can also add initials, dates, and checkmarks to complete forms.

        title: 'Redact PDF: Permanently Hide Sensitive Info',
        htmlContext: `
Blacking out text with a marker or a simple shape isn't safe—the text is often still underneath! Our **Redact PDF** tool *sanitizes* the document. It effectively burns a hole where the black box is, permanently removing the underlying text and metadata.

### Use Cases

* **Legal:** Hide names or addresses in court filings.
* **Finance:** Remove account numbers or balances.
* **HR:** Anonymize resumes or employee records.

Warning: Redaction is permanent. Once you save, the info is gone forever.

### Auto-Cleanup

`
    },
    '/ocr-pdf': {
        title: 'OCR PDF: Convert Scans to Searchable Text',
        htmlContext: `
Scanned PDFs are usually just pictures of text—you can't highlight, copy, or search them. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** solves this by analyzing the pixel shapes and converting them into real text data.

### Unlock Your Data

Once processed, you can:

* **Search:** Find a specific keyword in a 500-page scan.
* **Copy/Paste:** Move text into Word or Email.
* **Accessibility:** Make documents readable for screen readers.

        htmlContext: `
Ever opened a PDF and seen the window title read "Microsoft Word - Document1"? That's bad metadata. **Edit Metadata** lets you change the unseen properties of your file: **Title, Author, Subject, Keywords**, and **Creator**.

### Why it Matters

* **SEO:** Search engines read metadata to understand what a file is about.
* **Professionalism:** Ensure your client sees the correct document title, not a generic filename.
* **Organization:** Keywords help document management systems index your files.

    '/flatten-pdf': {
        title: 'Flatten PDF: Lock Forms and Layers',
        htmlContext: `
Interactive PDFs (with buttons, layers, and fillable forms) can look different on different devices. **Flatten PDF** merges all these dynamic elements into a single static layer.

### Why Flatten?

* **Prevent Edits:** Once flattened, form fields are no longer fillable. The data is baked onto the page.
* **Print Compatibility:** Complex layers can confuse printers. Flattening ensures what you see is what you print.
* **Speed:** Simple, flat PDFs render faster than complex layered ones.
