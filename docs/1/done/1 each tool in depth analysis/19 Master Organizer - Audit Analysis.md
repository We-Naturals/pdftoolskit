# Audit Analysis: Tool 19: Master Organizer
**Status**: 🟢 EXCEEDS DOCUMENTED STATE

| Aspect | Documented Vision | Actual Implementation | Gap Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | Single PDF Cleanup | **Multi-Document Studio** | **SUPERIOR**: Allows merging and reordering pages between *multiple* source files. |
| **Interaction** | Drag-and-drop | **Block Move Logic** | **SUPERIOR**: Support for Shift-select range moves and mass-deletion/rotation. |
| **Performance**| Serial Wait logic | **Cached Doc Registry** | **SUPERIOR**: Minimizes re-loads of source files during reconstruction. |
| **AI Features** | Roadmap (Blanks) | **Scan for Blanks Prototype** | **MATCHED**: UI Hooks already integrated for blank-page detection. |

**Audit Conclusion**: Tool 19 is the pinnacle of the structural toolkit. By implementing cross-document page migration and complex range-selection logic, it has already realized the "Document Studio" roadmap.
**Advancement Needed**: Real AI-driven blank page detection and structural suggestions.
