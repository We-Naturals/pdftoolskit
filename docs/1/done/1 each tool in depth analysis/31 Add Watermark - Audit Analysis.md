**Status**: 🟢 EXCEEDS DOCUMENTED STATE

| Aspect | Documented Vision | Actual Implementation | Gap Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | Text only | **Multi-Asset (Text + Image)** | **SUPERIOR**: Support for both professional text watermarks and logo/image embedding. |
| **Control** | Fixed Opacity | **Interactive CSS Overlay** | **SUPERIOR**: Live drag-to-position, rotate, and scale functionality. |
| **Tiling** | Single Stamp | **Tiling Logic** | **SUPERIOR**: Option to repeat watermark across the entire page for security. |
| **Positioning** | Center | **9-Point Grid + Freehand** | **SUPERIOR**: Precision snapping to corners, centers, and edges. |

**Audit Conclusion**: Tool 31 is highly advanced. The "God-Tier" roadmap items like Image watermarking and Tiling are already implemented.
**Advancement Needed**: Dynamic metadata watermarking (e.g., stamping the Current Time or User ID automatically).
