Besides Authentication (User Accounts), here is what we can do to make PDFToolskit a serious competitor to iLovePDF:

1. "The Money Maker" - Payments & Pro Plans
Goal: Actually make money.
Action: Integrate Stripe or LemonSqueezy.
Features: Only allow OCR, High Compression, or >10MB files to users who pay $5/mo.
2. "The Traffic Magnet" - Automated SEO Blog
Goal: Get free traffic from Google.
Action: Create a script (or use an API) to auto-generate blog posts like "How to Convert PDF to Word for Free" every day.
Why: More pages = More keywords = More visitors.
3. "The Heavy Tools" - Missing Features
Sign PDF: Add a real digital signature pad (draw/type signature).
Edit PDF: Add text/images to existing PDFs (like a mini-editor).
Unlock PDF: Crucial for people with forgotten passwords.
4. "The Polished App" - Performance & UX
Dark Mode Polish: Make sure every single corner looks perfect in Dark Mode.
Speed: Optimize the PDF worker so it loads in <1s.
My Advice: Strictly prioritize #1 (Auth & Payments). Without users, the other features don't matter as much. Do you agree with starting the Sign Up / Sign In flow next?
